Right now, I am trying to extract multi-page data from TripAdvisor by using string.  
I am facing a problem (my computer is Mac) when installing: browser = webdriver.Chrome('chromedriver.exe') Then it came out as: WebDriverException: 'chromedriver.exe' executable needs to be in PATH. Please see https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home  

So I followed this link and download the Chromedriver to install in my Mac.  
When I double clicked to install then my computer shows: “chromedriver” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer
On this topic matter, I am looking forward to hearing advice from each and everyone of you.  
I hope you might take sometime to guide me get out of this problem.
